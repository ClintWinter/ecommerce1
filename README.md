# Work environment setup

Continue to use vagrant/homestead for php/mysql/etc.

## Add docker
* Are docker volumes persistent between machines?
    * Then we could use homestead for dev env and docker for keeping a persistent database between all dev machines

## Benefits
* We are setup with the same environment as production
* We can quickly get a new PC up and running on the same environment.
